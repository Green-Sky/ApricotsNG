# ApricotsNG

A Apricots port to SDL2 and a modern build system (cmake).

[try Emscripten-port in browser](https://green-sky.github.io/ApricotsNG/)

Should build on any modern build system supporting at least cmake 3.0 and c++.

## Important Changes

- all resources have been moved to `res/`
- all source files have been moved to `src/`
- now requires SDL2 :smirk:
- doesn't require alut, when using OpenAL (file loading is now implemented in sdl)
